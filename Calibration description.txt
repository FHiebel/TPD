#Goal and technical background:

Analyse a series of temperature programmed desorption spectra (mass spectrometer signal versus time) acquired for different doses in order to calibrate the dosage to surface coverage relationship. 

The spectra consist of mass spectrometer signal (arb. u.) versus time (t). During an experiment, the temperature (T) is ramped up at a constant rate so that T=beta * t.
Dosage is expressed in Langmuirs (L). 1 L= 1. 10^-6 mbar.s 
Note: Another parameter can come into play in quantifying the dosage depending on what is dosed on the surface: in some experiments atomic O is dosed from the thermal cracking of O2. The filament power in the cracker controls the fraction of O/O2 to which the surface is exposed and thus the eventual O dose. This is specific to this example.
